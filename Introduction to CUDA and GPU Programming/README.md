  Let’s dive in!

## Why Learn CUDA?
Parallel computing is essential in today’s world, where applications are growing more complex and data-heavy. Traditional CPUs process tasks sequentially, but GPUs can handle thousands of operations simultaneously. CUDA gives you access to this capability, allowing you to significantly accelerate the performance of applications like simulations, machine learning, and image processing.
