## What's CUDA? and Why?
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. It allows developers to harness the power of NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate computing-intensive tasks. Whether you’re working on real-time data processing, image processing, scientific simulations, or deep learning, CUDA provides the tools to take advantage of GPU performance.

In this guide, we’ll cover the essentials of CUDA programming :)
